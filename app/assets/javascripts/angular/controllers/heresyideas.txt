_ideas_

shadow team or known?
chaos marine promised a demon by high priest of darkness?
chaos marine battle in forge/somewhere else involving hiding? cemetary? crypt?
hereteks building titan?
cult with "son of emperor" during routine heresy sweep?
imperial guard turned to khorne or nergal (Heart of Darkness)?
someone ranting about the glory of slaanesh? noble who frequents pleasure pit?
slaanesh cult pleasure pit?
cult with bound demonhost (in basement of palace maybe?)
bound demonhost can tell future(if commanded, can lie otherwise)
trapped upside down in room at the end of a dark hallway
demon powers cause ambushes, cult to be "one step ahead"
ork invasion -> exterminatus in three days
caused by radical inquisitor testing orks as weapon
ork overrun defenses, team must retreat to roof of building to get to last shuttle
ask team about purge/exterminatus at some point?
church takes shuttles while civilians stay behind
"excommunicatis traitoris" -> probably run until they can get to own inquisitor
inquisitor killed?
ordo xenos inquisitor has psyker bodyguard
Adeptes Arbites versus well-meaning rebels
Atheist Scholars...on happiest, most successful planet
rebellion against rich people in hive city
space hulk out of nowhere
prison ship rebellion / scary rogue trader ship
space marines going rogue?
